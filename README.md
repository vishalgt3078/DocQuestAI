# Retrieval-Based Question Answering System

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of advanced technologies like Qdrant and Google Palm LLM to build a sophisticated and scalable retrieval-based question-answering system. The system efficiently retrieves relevant documents from a large collection and generates precise, context-aware responses by leveraging semantic search and natural language processing capabilities.

## Features

- *Semantic Search*: Uses embeddings to convert both documents and queries into vector representations, enabling efficient similarity searches in a vector database.
- *Advanced Document Retrieval*: Employs Qdrant, a high-performance vector database, to store and manage document embeddings, facilitating fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents.
- *Natural Language Processing*: Integrates Google Palm LLM to interpret queries and generate coherent, contextually appropriate answers based on the retrieved documents.
- *Scalability*: Designed to handle large-scale document collections, ensuring high performance and quick response times even as the dataset grows.

## Use Cases

- *Customer Support*: Automate responses to customer queries by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating accurate answers.
- *Research and Development*: Facilitate the exploration of large datasets by retrieving and summarizing key information from research papers, technical documents, or other text collections.
- *Content Management*: Enable intelligent search and content delivery by understanding the context and relevance of user queries.
